# Used Fonts

## Open Sans

`Open Sans` is used by the `beautiful-jekyll` theme. So we adopt this font for all kinds of headers and captions.

## Lora

`Lora` is again used by the `beaufiful-jekyll` theme as standard font for content. That's the same case here. The *mantra* words in the logo files are also displayed in with this font.

## PlaylistFF

The playlist font is only used for the word `Jekyll` in the logo files. Its purpose is to highlight the words by using a very different font face. In addition to that, it mimics the font of the original jekyll logo.
