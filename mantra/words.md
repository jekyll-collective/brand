# About the Mantra

> The `Mantra` is a basic maxim we all try to follow.

These are the 3 basic motives our mission statement ist build on:

## Inspiring

All the communication and conversation in our community should be inspiring for all.

## Creative

If your in a inspiring mood you easily get creative and start working on new projects. This leads into creating
something new or customizing pre-existing things to fulfill your individual needs. That's our goal :D - We try
to help each other to create awesome things while enjoying the process. - We often forget how exciting it is to
create something in this digital world. So sometimes we just need a little help to stay focused.

## Experienced

Keep in mind we all are experts :D. So please behave as such. Nothing is worse than a impolite and disrespectful
conversation. We all try help with quality and not with quantity.
